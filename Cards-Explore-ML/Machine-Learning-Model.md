The term, Machine Learning, often mystifies its nature of computer science, as its name might suggest that the machine is learning as human does, or even better. 
Despite the hope that one day we could have machines that think and learn the way that humans do, machine learning nowadays does not go beyond a computer program that performs the predefined procedures. What distinguishes a machine learning algorithm from a non machine learning algorithm, such as a program that controls traffic lights, is its ability to adapt its behaviours to new input. And this adaptation, which seems to have no human intervention, occasionally leads to the impression that the machine is actually learning. However, underneath the machine learning model, this adaptation of behaviours, is as rigid as every bit of machine instructions that are programmed by humans. 

So what is a machine learning model ? 
  A machine learning algorithm is the process that uncovers the underlying relationship within the data;
  The outcome of a machine learning algorithm is called machine learning model, which can be considered as a function FF, which outputs     certain results, when given the input;
  Rather than a predefined and fixed function, a machine learning model is derived from historical data. Therefore, when fed with           different data, the output of machine learning algorithm changes, i.e. the machine learning model changes;
